# emdash-cloudflare-email

EmDash CMS plugin that delivers system email (magic link / invite / password
reset) through the native [Cloudflare Email Sending](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/)
Workers binding.

It registers the exclusive `email:deliver` transport on EmDash's email
pipeline, so any time EmDash sends an email it goes through `env.EMAIL.send()`
on your Cloudflare Worker — **no API keys, no SMTP, no external SaaS.**

> Targets the **EmDash 0.19** plugin model. This is a full rewrite of the
> 0.9-era plugin and is **not backward compatible** — see
> [Migrating from 0.1.x](#migrating-from-01x).

## Requirements

- An EmDash project on **0.19.0 or newer**.
- Hosting on **Cloudflare Workers** (not Pages, not Node).
- Your sender domain must be onboarded to Cloudflare Email Sending:
  Dashboard → **Compute → Email Service → Email Sending → Onboard Domain**, or
  `wrangler email sending enable yourdomain.com`. Cloudflare auto-installs the
  SPF / DKIM / DMARC records.
- Cloudflare Email Sending requires the Workers Paid plan to send to arbitrary
  recipients (the free tier is limited to verified destinations only).

## Installation

```sh
pnpm add emdash-cloudflare-email
# or: npm i emdash-cloudflare-email
```

## Setup

### 1. Add the `send_email` binding to `wrangler.jsonc`

```jsonc
{
  "send_email": [
    { "name": "EMAIL" }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Register the plugin in `astro.config.mjs`

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import emdash from 'emdash/astro';
import cloudflareEmail from 'emdash-cloudflare-email';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    emdash({
      // ...your other config
      // Must be `plugins:` (in-process), NOT `sandboxed:` — the plugin needs
      // the host Worker's `send_email` binding, which is not exposed inside an
      // isolate.
      plugins: [cloudflareEmail()],
    }),
  ],
});
```

That's it for code. EmDash discovers the plugin from the descriptor — there's
no manual `_plugin_state` / `options` SQL to run anymore (that was required on
0.9; it is gone on 0.19).

### 3. Configure the From address in the admin UI

Deploy, then open the EmDash admin → **Cloudflare Email** settings page:

- **From Address** — `Your App <noreply@yourdomain.com>` (or just
  `noreply@yourdomain.com`). Must be on a domain onboarded to Cloudflare Email
  Sending.
- **Binding Name** — optional; defaults to `EMAIL`. Set this only if your
  wrangler `send_email` binding uses a different name.

Use **Send Test Email** on the same page to verify delivery, then select this
provider under EmDash → **Settings → Email** (it claims the exclusive
`email:deliver` slot).

## API

### `cloudflareEmail()`

Returns an EmDash `PluginDescriptor` (standard format). Takes no arguments —
EmDash 0.19 standard-format plugins are configured at runtime via the admin
settings page (stored in plugin KV), not via descriptor options.

| Descriptor field | Value |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| `id`             | `cf-email-sending` |
| `capabilities`   | `['email:provide']` — grants registration of the exclusive `email:deliver` hook |
| `format`         | `standard` |

## How it works

EmDash's auth flow (magic link, invite, password reset) and any plugin calling
`ctx.email.send()` feed into the email pipeline:

1. `email:beforeSend` middleware hooks run.
2. The message is dispatched to **exactly one** `email:deliver` provider —
   this plugin.
3. `email:afterSend` fire-and-forget hooks run.

This plugin's `email:deliver` handler:

1. Reads the configured From address (and binding name) from plugin KV.
2. Resolves the `send_email` binding off `cloudflare:workers`'s `env`.
3. Calls `binding.send({ to, from, subject, text, html })` with the message
   EmDash assembled.
4. Throws on a missing binding / missing config / send error so EmDash records
   the failure.

## Migrating from 0.1.x

The plugin was rewritten for EmDash 0.19. If you used `0.1.x`:

- **Entrypoint** — `createCfEmailPlugin({ from })` is removed. Use
  `cloudflareEmail()` and set the From address in the admin UI instead.
- **astro.config** — drop the inline `{ id, version, format, entrypoint,
  capabilities }` plugin object and the `capabilities:
  ['hooks.email-transport:register']` line. Just pass `cloudflareEmail()` to
  `plugins:`.
- **Bootstrap SQL** — delete the manual `_plugin_state` / `options` D1 inserts.
  EmDash installs and activates the plugin from the admin UI now.

## Caveats

- EmDash's `EmailMessage` does not carry a `from` field, so this plugin injects
  one from the admin-configured From address.
- The plugin must run via `plugins:` (in-process), not `sandboxed:`. A sandbox
  isolate does not receive the host Worker's `send_email` binding.
- If Email Sending isn't enabled on the zone, sends fail with
  `destination address is not a verified address`.
